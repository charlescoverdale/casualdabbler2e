# Bayesian for the common man

## Probability refresher

Bayes' Theorem is named after 18th-century British statistician and theologian, Thomas Bayes. The theorem describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

In traditional frequentist statistics, probability is interpreted as the long-run frequency of events in repeated trials.

Bayesian statistics, on the other hand, allows us to incorporate prior knowledge or beliefs into our analysis and update those beliefs as we gather more data.

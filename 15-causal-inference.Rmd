# Causal inference

*Note: Chapter under development*

## What causes what

Causal inference the process of determining cause-and-effect relationships. Simply finding an association between two variables might be suggestive of a causal effect... but it also might not.

The best book on this topic is [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/) by the phenomenally talented Scott Cunningham.

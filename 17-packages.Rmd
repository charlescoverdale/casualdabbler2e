# Packages

*Note: Chapter under development*

## Pack it up

The 'fundamental unit of shareable code' is a package. At its core, a package is about automation, convenience, and integrity. Rather than copy-pasting, or repeating analytical steps, a package guarantees the same functions are available time and time again.

The best book on this topic is [R Packages (2e)](https://r-pkgs.org/) by Hadley Wickham and Jenifer Bryan.
